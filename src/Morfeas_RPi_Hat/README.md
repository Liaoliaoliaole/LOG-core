[//]: # (
## Getting Started

In the "Design and source" folder, can be found.
* [The Firmware source code](https://gitlab.com/fantomsam/wind_station/tree/master/Design_and_source/Firmware)
* [PCB Design Files](https://gitlab.com/fantomsam/wind_station/tree/master/Design_and_source/Hardware)

In the "Docs" folder, can be found.
* [The Technical Manual](https://gitlab.com/fantomsam/wind_station/raw/master/Docs/Documentation/Technical_manual.pdf?inline=false)
* [Useful Datasheets](https://gitlab.com/fantomsam/wind_station/tree/master/Docs/Datasheet)

### Prerequisites

For Firmware compilation the following toolkits are required

* [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) - Small Device C Compiler suite (>=3.9.0)
* [GPUTILS](https://gputils.sourceforge.io/) - GPUTILS is a collection of tools for the PIC microcontrollers (>=1.5.2)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - GNU make utility

### Compilation
To compile the firmware (tested under GNU/Linux only)
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/fantomsam/wind_station.git
$ cd wind_station/Design_and_source/Firmware
$ make tree
$ make
```
The binary file located under the build directory.
